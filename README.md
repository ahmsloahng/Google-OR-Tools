## TSP Discrete Optimization
The solution of Travelling Salesman Problem from Discrete Optimization course is posted here. 'data-tsp' contains a collection of tsp problems. Most of the problems are solved and the solutions are in 'OR Tools solution' folder. 
'tabu-insert.py' is the code where the implementation of Nearest Neighbourhood (Greedy), 2-opt (Interchange Heuristics) and Tabu Search (Meta-heuristics) with insertion move is available. 
'solver-tsp.py' is the code which is the implementation of Google OR Tools for TSP using Guided Local Search.
The Vehicle Routing Problem codes from Google OR Tools are implemented
